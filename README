This program is written to investigate if PangoLayout can be used
when I wish to mark a tibetan vowel as red text.

I used 2 ways:

  1. markup
  2. PangoAttribute

Both of the ways seems failed: both the vowel and consonants were
marked in resulted pdf file.

If you think I made a mistake, just tell me. I'd be happy to hear :)


"So dear students, the vowel 'naro' looks like the red part ... wait, there's
something wrong..."
